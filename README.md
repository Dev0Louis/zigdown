# Zigdown: Markdown parser in Zig

Inspired by [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow), the goal is to create a simple terminal-based Markdown renderer just for fun.

Note: This doesn't really do much... ...yet. Very simple Markdown can be rendered to HTML and to the console.

## Usage

The current version of Zig this code compiles with is [zig-0.11.0-dev.3222](https://ziglang.org/builds/zig-linux-x86_64-0.11.0-dev.3222+7077e90b3.tar.xz).

```shell
zig build run
zig build -l # List build options
```
